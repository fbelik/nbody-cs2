# nbody-cs2

NBody project made in my Computer Science 2 course using standard lib from
Sedgewig and Wayne. The user can pass in a total time, time step, and a 
txt file that contains a set of planets, and visualize how those planets
travel though space as they are pulled by other planets of varying masses.
