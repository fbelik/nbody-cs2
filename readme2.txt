Hours to complete assignment (optional):

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/
Since I started this assignment before Professor Yu started teaching
us about arrays, and importing standard library, I had the most
trouble achieving those two things. 

/**********************************************************************
 *  If you created your own universe for extra credit, describe it
 *  here and why it is interesting.  Be sure to include the necessary
 *  in the resources folder and tell us how to load your universe.
 **********************************************************************/
I created a universe called myTest.txt which creates 8 planets orbiting
the sun in extreme elliptical orbits. It is interesting because the
planets all start in the same phase of orbit, but over time, they mess
each other up. Also, the synchronity at the start creates a cool pattern.
Load with java -cp .:lib/stdlib.jar NBody 315000000 7500 myTest.txt
if in the resources folder.

/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) that you received. You don't need to
 *  include the course materials or lectures, but do include any
 *  additional help your received from people (course staff, lab TAs,
 *  classmates) and include their names.
 **********************************************************************/
I recieved help compiling with classpaths from my lab instructor Jeff 
Inglehardt.

/**********************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here.
